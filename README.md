# SAV126 – Technical Assignment Solution

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the SAVTOA Software Technologies technical assignment (Candidate ID: SAV126).

The assignment includes two independent problems in here:

1. Smart Device Control System (Object-Oriented Programming)
2. Situational Awareness \& Collision Risk System (Simulation)

Both solutions are designed to be simple, clear, and can be run locally without using any cloud services.

1) Question 1 – Smart Device Control System

### Description

This solution demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as:

* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation

A common device interface is created, and multiple devices (Motor, Light) are controlled through a controller without knowing their exact type.

### Technology Used

* Python 3

### How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the `questionone` folder.

4. Run: python device_system.py

### Expected Output
Messages showing devices starting and stopping correctly.




2) Question 2 – Situational Awareness and Collision Risk System


### Description


This solution simulates a vessel and surrounding targets to identify collision risks.


Features:

* Own vessel displayed at the center

* Multiple moving targets

* Distance-based risk classification (Safe / Warning / Danger)

* Visual and text alerts

* Start and Pause simulation controls


### Technology Used

* HTML

* JavaScript

* HTML Canvas


### How to Run


1. Open the `questiontwo` folder.

2. Double-click `index.html`.

3. The simulation will open in your browser.

4. Click *Start* to begin the simulation.

5. Click *Pause* to stop it.


No installation or server setup is required.



3) Testing

* Question 1 was tested by running the Python file locally.

* Question 2 was tested by opening the HTML file in a browser.

* No runtime or functional errors were observed.


4) Assumptions and Limitations


* Risk analysis in Question 2 is based on distance for simplicity.

* Advanced calculations like CPA/TCPA can be extended if required.

* The solution focuses on clarity and correctness as requested.
