# SAV126 – Technical Assignment Solution

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the SAVTOA Software Technologies technical assignment (Candidate ID: SAV126).

This repository focuses on Question 1 of the assignment:

1. Smart Device Control System (Object-Oriented Programming)

The solutions are designed to be simple, clear, and can be run locally without using any cloud services.

1) Question 1 – Smart Device Control System

### Description

This solution demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as:

* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation

A common device interface is created, and multiple devices (Motor, Light) are controlled through a controller without knowing their exact type.

### Technology Used

* Python 3

### How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the `questionone` folder.

4. Run the following command: python device_system.py

### Expected Output
Motor is switched ON
Motor is switched OFF
Light is switched ON
Light is switched OFF

3) Testing

* Question 1 was tested by running the Python file locally.

* No runtime or functional errors were observed.


4) Assumptions and Limitations

* The solution focuses on clarity and correctness as requested.
